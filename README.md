# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive, visually-appealing webpage which allows visitors to filter through UFO sighting data. Not only would that be useful for people interested in examining/slicing UFO data, but also it would be a compelling addition to a portfolio for an aspiring NASA data scientist.

## Results
The webpage provides a nice image and text-based introduction; however, the real meat of it is the data table beneath those.

There is a lot of raw data to sift through, but the helpful filter options on the left-hand side make it very user friendly. To operate them, a visitor can simply type into any of the five white input boxes to filter the data by their specific criteria. Any or all five can be used at a time to drill down on whatever specific UFO sightings are desired.

## Summary
Though the site is off to a great start, there remains plenty of room for improvement going forward. Perhaps the biggest drawback is that there is no easy way to see all the options that exist in the table. By making the filters into dropdown menus that can also be typed into, the user would be empowered to select from a list of options rather than needing to know exactly what filter was needed. Additionally, adding some type of counter table to the site would be great too. I can imagine it would be very useful for a user to be able to see which states, shapes, dates, etc. had the most UFO sightings.
